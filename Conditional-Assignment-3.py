# Fix the mistakes in this code and test based on the description below
# If a student has 3 or more unexecused absences he/she is dropped from class 
# If I enter 3 I should see the message "You will be dropped from class" 
# If I enter 0 I should see the message "You are awesome!!! Keep up the great work" 
# If I enter 1 I should see the message "Make sure to let your instructor know if you're going to miss any classes" 

absences = input('how many unexecused absences? ')
#HINT: THe next line should take into account that user entered a string...you will need to treat price as a number

if absences > 3:
	print("You will be dropped"
elif absences >= 1:
print("")
else:
print("")
